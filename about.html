                        <p>
                            Nothing But Nets is a global grassroots campaign to raise awareness and funding to fight malaria, a leading cause of death among children in Africa. Nothing But Nets allows everyone from students to CEOs, bishops to basketball players to join the fight against malaria by giving $10 to send a net and save a life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the United Nations Foundation has been working with the UN to fight malaria for years, it was Rick Reilly&#39;s column about malaria in Sports Illustrated challenging each of his readers to donate at least $10 to send insecticide-treated bed nets, that led to the creation of the Nothing But Nets campaign in 2006.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, the campaign has engaged hundreds of thousands of individuals to help achieve the UN goal of ending malaria deaths in this generation. We work with a diverse group of partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Basketball Association&#39;s NBA Cares, The People of The United Methodist Church, Major League Soccer&#39;s MLS WORKS, the Union for Reform Judaism and Junior Chamber International, among others.

                        <p>
                            The success of Nothing But Nets is a testament to the power of passionate people coming together to make the world a better, healthier place. You can save a family. Your church, school, or sports team can save a community. Together, we can cover Africa with life-saving bed nets.
